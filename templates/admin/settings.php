    <h2>Juxtapose Images Guidelines</h2>
	<p>Using this plugin is very simple. You just need to use the <strong>[juxtapose]...[/juxtapose]</strong> shortcode in your post or pages.</p>
	<p>If you want to know more about shortcodes, please visit the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode">wordpress shortcodes page.</a></p>
	<h2>How To Use It</h2>
	<xmp>[juxtapose]
	<img src="/.../image1" />
	<img src="/.../image2" />
[/juxtapose]</xmp>
	<p>Simply add 2 images <strong>with the same dimensions</strong> in your post or page, wrapped by the text <strong>[juxtapose]...[/juxtapose]</strong> (Pay attention to the /). That's all. The plugin will find these images and will create the correct markup and javascript calls for showing the slider.</p>
	<p>You can use the visual editor or the html editor. Both should work. If you see the text [juxtapose] in your code, then swith to the text editor.</p>
	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Any text or extra html markup beetween [juxtapose] and [/juxtapose] will be ignored, as it doesn't make sense. Any image style will be ignored, because the plugin needs to apply its custom style.</li>
		<li>The plugin will only work with 2 images. If there are less or more than two, it will do nothing, showing the original markup as if the [juxtapose] shortcode doesn't exists.</li>
		<li>The plugin is very fast and the overhead is minimum. The css and javascript is around 20 kb and only included when needed.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Credits and Resources</h2>
